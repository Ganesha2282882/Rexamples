# Examples
These are some Python Examples from REPL.IT.

Wanna put some examples in your Python Code? Well, easy, just do the following:
1. Put the `Examples.py` file in your code.
2. Put this in your code:
You need the function `import Examples as e` and one of the functions e.g. `hello()`.
```python
import Examples as e
e.fserver() # Flask Server
e.nput() # User Input
e.ftorial() # Factorial
e.hello() # Hello World
e.floop() # For loop
```
3. Execute your code!

If you want to view the example raw, visit the file `raw_example`.
